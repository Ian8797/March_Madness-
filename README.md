# March_Madness-
This project was motivated by a yearly Kaggle Competition to predict the outcomes of the NCAA Basketball Tournament. 
This project helped me vastly improve my SQL skills while also utilizing interesting tools in Python like Sklearn and 
Tensorflow. After aggregating team statisitcs I used a few machine learing techniques such as Regression, PCA and 
Feedfoward Neural Networks to predict game outcomes to 73% accuracy
